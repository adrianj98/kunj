Changes made with Claude, and why.

## 2026-10-07 — Release v1.1.0

Released everything since v1.0.1 so `kunj repos` / `kunj install` reach npm and the release carries the
macOS app zip (`kunj install macos` needs a release that has one).

- `kunj repos` — registry of repositories kunj has been used in (`~/.kunj/repos.json`), so the macOS app can discover them.
- macOS menu bar app (`macos-app/`) — same features as the VS Code extension; open worktrees first and highlighted,
  "Open only" toggle, adaptive light/dark palette, panel stays pinned under the menu bar when it shrinks.
- Release workflow attaches `Kunj-macos-<version>.zip` (unsigned) next to the `.vsix`.
- `kunj install [vscode|macos|all]` — downloads and installs the companion apps; offered at the end of `kunj setup`.
- Also in this release: hooks, new branches from the fetched default branch, `worktree add -c`, config variables,
  bare repository support, keep files.
